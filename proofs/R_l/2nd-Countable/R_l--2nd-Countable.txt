Let \( \mathcal{B} \) be a basis of \( \mathbb{R}_l \).
For each \(x\), \( [x, x+1) \) is open in \( \mathbb{R}_l \).
So by <a href="/P-S-Topology/definitions/Basis.html">definition of basis</a>, \( \exists B_x \in \mathcal{B} \) such that \( x \in B_x \ \subseteq [x, x+1) \).
If \( x \neq y \), since \( x =  \inf B_x \) and \( y =  \inf B_y \), \( B_x \neq B_y \).
There are uncountable many of \(x\) in \(\mathbb{R}_l\), so there are uncountable many of \( B_x \) in \( \mathcal{B} \).
Therefore \( \mathcal{B} \) is uncountable.
\(\iff \nexists \) a countable basis of  \( \mathbb{R}_l \).
\(\implies \mathbb{R}_l\) is not second countable
