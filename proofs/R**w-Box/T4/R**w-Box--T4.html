    <h1>
      Whether \( \mathbb{R}^\omega \) with box topology is normal (T4) is still
      an open question.
    </h1>
    <p>
      “It is not known whether \( \mathbb{R}^\omega \) is normal in the box
      topology. Mary-Ellen Rudin has shown that the answer is affirmative if one
      assumes the continuum hypothesis [RM]. In fact, she shows it satisfies a
      stronger condition called paracompactness.” — quoted from Exercise 32.5 in
      Munkres<
