Because <a href="/P-S-Topology/proofs/R**w-Uni/Metrizable/R**w-Uni--Metrizable.html">\( \mathbb{R}^\omega \) with the uniform topology is metrizable</a>,

and <a href="/P-S-Topology/theorems/Exercise-32-7-d.html">any metrizable space is completely normal (T5)</a>.

Therefore \( \mathbb{R}^\omega \) with the uniform topology is completely normal (T5).
