    <h1>Basis</h1>
    <p>
      <em>Definition: </em> If \(X\) is a set, a basis for a topology on \(X\)
      is a collection \(\mathcal{B}\) of subsets of \(X\) (called basis
      elements) such that
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) For each \(x \in X\), there is at least one basis element \(B\)
      containing \(x\).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) If \(x\) belongs to the intersection of two basis elements \(B_1\) and
      \(B_2\), then there is a basis element \(B_3\) containing \(x\) such that
      \(B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2\).
    </p>
    <p>
      If \(\mathcal{B}\) satisfies these two conditions, then we define the
      topology \(\mathcal{T}\) generated by \(\mathcal{B}\) as follows: A
      subseteq \(U\) of \(X\) is said to be open in \(X\) (that is, to be an
      element of \(\mathcal{T}\)) if for each \(x \in U\), there is a basis
      element \(B \in \mathcal{B}\) such that \(x \in B\) and \(B \subseteq U\).
    </p>
    <p>Note that each basis element is itself an element of \(\mathcal{T}\).</p>
